    <h1>Real Madrid</h1>
    <div>Kylian Mbappé is the fastest player in the Real Madrid locker room. At least for now, the Frenchman has the highest top
    speed recorded to date out of all of the current squad. Mbappé has reached a max sprint speed of 37.9 km/h, according to
    speedsdb.com studio.</div>
    <div class="first">Who Is The Richest Football Club In The World? Real Madrid have overtaken Manchester City to become the richest football
    club in the world. Increases in commercial and matchday revenue saw Los Blancos leapfrog City in the rich list.</div>
    <div class="second">Not the list Barcelona would like to lead. Indeed, Barcelona duo Robert Lewandowski and Frenkie de Jong top the list of
    the highest-paid players in La Liga for the 2024/25 season, according to data from 90Min. Frenkie de Jong leads with an
    annual salary of €37.5 million, followed by Robert Lewandowski at €33.5 million.</div>
    <div class="third">Messi's Argentina bested Mbappe's France in a penalty shootout, but the two are far from rivals. In fact, in an
    interview with Amazon Prime Sport, Mbappe defended Messi, saying that the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner wasn't treated
    fairly during their time together at Paris Saint-Germain</div>
